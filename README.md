# CODEFLASK-ARITH-JS

This post shows a React app using **create-react-app**, 
**hooks**, **styled-components**, **CodeFlask** and 
[arith-js](https://github.com/tuan-ng/arith-js). It 
illustrates the working of an interpreter and a 
compiler for an arithmetic language discussed 
in [another post](https://github.com/tuan-ng/arith-js). 

**hooks** is very convenient to use, with 
`useState`, `useEffect`, and so on. 
`useEffect` is all three 
`componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and 
`componentWillUnmount` combined, which sometimes is not exactly what we want, but **hooks**
provides a check that makes it possible to isolate 
`componentDidMount`; this is used in the current 
post for **CodeFlask**. 


Some screenshots are shown below. To play live with the 
app, go [here](https://tuan-ng.github.io/codeflask-arith-js/)!
